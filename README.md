# Counting Crystals

## A game played by adding numbers together to equal a randomized sum without going over.

I've programmed a small game that uses React to apply randomly generated numbers to a set of four "crystals" with a fifth, larger number being generated for a target sum displayed at the top of the screen. When the user clicks on a crystal, it adds the number to a running score. Over time, the user learns each crystals value and, if added correctly, equals the exact target number, winning the game. 

Future plans include sound effects, click animations, and "confetti" for the win.
